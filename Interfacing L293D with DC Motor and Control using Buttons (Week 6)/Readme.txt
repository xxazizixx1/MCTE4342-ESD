Assalamualaikum W.B.T, Im Azizi Bin Mohamad Tambi.

This folder (Interfacing L293D with DC Motor and Control using Buttons) contain the codes(in C++), schematic view, circuit view, and list of components used.

Project Description: 
1. In this project, I use a 5 L293D driver motor to control the rotation of 2 DC motors using buttons.
2. When Button 1 is pressed, motor 1 will change direction. When button 2 is pressed, motor 2 will also change direction.
3. When both button 1 and button 2 is pressed, both motor will stop rotating.

Discussion:
1. Using L293D driver motor, we can control many features in regard to motors.
2. In DC motors, we can control the direction and the rotation speed of the motors using L293D driver.
3. To control the speed of the DC motor, we can set the input pin of L293D to analog input of Arduino uno.
4. By connecting the input as analog, we can vary the value of the input and thus control the motor speed.
