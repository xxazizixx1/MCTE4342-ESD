Assalamualaikum W.B.T, Im Azizi Bin Mohamad Tambi.

This folder (Read FSR+LDR write on TXT file (Memory External)) contain the codes(in C++), schematic view, circuit view, and list of components used.

Project Description: 
1. In this project, we want to output the value from FSR and LDR onto a text file on the local machine. 
2. To do this, firstly download a software named "CoolTerm" on this website (https://freeware.the-meiers.org/).
3. Extract the file downloaded and then open the software.
4. Before using Coolterm, close any serial terminal that is currently opened from the arduino ide.
5. On Coolterm, go to the option window and select appropriate port and set the baudrate to 9600.
6. Then, go to "Connection" and select "Capture to Text/Binary file" and then create the txt file.
7. After the file is created, press connect and the data will be logged into the txt file.

Discussion:
1. Compared to EEPROM, using external memorry for data logger is better as external memory usually has bigger space.
2. The data logged onto the .txt file can be used for troubleshooting and it can be transferred to excel to be plotted into a graph.
