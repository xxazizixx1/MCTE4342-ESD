Project Description: 
1. In this project, I use 8 LEDS as an output and assigned 2 button to act as an input.
2. The aim of the project is to shift the LED from left to right or vice versa through shifting the registers.
3. In this activity, when the button on the left is pressed, the LED that is off will shift from left to right.
4. When button on your right hand side is pressed, the LED shift from right to left.
