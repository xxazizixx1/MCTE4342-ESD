Assalamualaikum W.B.T, Im Azizi Bin Mohamad Tambi.

This folder (PWM LED Control using Buttons) contain the codes(in C++), schematic view, circuit view, and list of components used.

Project Description: 
1. In this project, I use a 2 buttons to control the PWM of the LED to make it brighter or dimmer.
2. What I wanted to create here is a simple LED controller that allows us to control the brightness of the LED.

Discussion:
1. To control LED using PWM, we must first map the LED so that the range of the PWM will be around 0~255.
2. As the value of the PWM goes high, the LED will become brighter.
3. By using buttons, we can create an interval to increase or decrease the value of the PWM.

Problem encounter:
1. No problem found.
