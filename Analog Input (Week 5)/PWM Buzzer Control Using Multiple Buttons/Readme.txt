Assalamualaikum W.B.T, Im Azizi Bin Mohamad Tambi.

This folder (PWM Buzzer Control Using Multiple Button) contain the codes(in C++), schematic view, circuit view, and list of components used.

Project Description: 
1. In this project, I use a 5 buttons to increase or decrease the frequency of the buzzer.
2. What I wanted to create here is a simple piano where you can adjust the frequency accordingly to create your own notes.

Discussion:
1. The PWM value for the buzzer can be controlled by using button where we can create an interval to increase or decrease the value of the PWM.
2. By adjusting the value of the PWM, we can tune our buzzer to produce desired sound.
3. By using multiple buzzer, we can create a simple piano and play the notes that we adjust earlier.
4. The idea here is that, in real life, instrument such as guitar will need to be adjust manually by turning the tuner for each string.
5. With the help of PWM, we can digitally control the frequency needed to produce certain tone.

Problem encounter:
1. I was not able to run the system due to the buzzer not connected to a resistor. One of the terminal on the button must be connected with a resistor so the program will be able to run.
